# Nonsense Haiku Generator

My First Project as part of the Codecademy Full Stack Curriculum

## This is a very simple JS function that will return 3 random lines of 10 possible real haikus.

## Each line is independently chosen, how many times will you have to run it to get a poem that makes even a little sense?

### Credit to https://examples.yourdictionary.com/20-funny-haiku-poems-examples-for-all-ages.html for all of the haikus.

To get your own WaCkY haiku, simply:
- Branch this project
- Load it in your text editor
- Open terminal or command prompt
- Run script node main.js

### Thanks for checking out my first project!
